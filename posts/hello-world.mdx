# Hello, World!

Well this has been such an interesting experience that I really did not expect
to endure. My project started as just a means for me to learn C++.
After looking into inheritance I decided that the next logical step was to
make a game engine...

Ok, to be fair I actually just wanted to make a game. But, when presented with the
options to either use an existing game engine or make my own...well I did not
spend the last 2 weeks (at the time) learning C++ just to swap over to Unity3D, which
is what I used for my first game 4 years ago. Unreal Engine was most certainly a viable option
but given that I wanted to focus on 2D arcade games, I felt that Unreal Engine was a bit
overkill for what I wanted to accomplish.

> **Prior to this endeavor the most software engineering experience I have to my name was full stack web development.**

I do have about 7 years of professional experience working in software,
even if it is nearly all in front end web development. I guess what I am trying to say is that my entire
suite of skills do not translate 1:1 into game development, I like to think that I had
enough knowhow to at least give it a shot. The worst that could happen is no one likes my game.

> **I honestly believe is all anyone ever needs is to just be given a shot, if someone does not come along to offer such opportunity, I feel that it is your duty to make one.**

So here, I am two months later and I have quite a bit to show for what I have built.
I have gone from `std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;` to several working levels
in the first game to be built in my engine, **Ultra Cosmo Invaders**.

**Ultra Cosmo Invaders** is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga">Galaga</a>
clone that I felt was a good start to build with. Albiet, I figured something like
Asteroids or Space Invaders would have been even easier to build. Once I replayed both
of those games, I just didn't have as much fun playing them as I thought I would have.
Bottom line is that I cannot force myself to build a game that I myself am not
motivated to play, so Galaga it is! To be very honest, I did not even realize I was making
Galaga until other people told me that the game I had was similar. I chalk that up
to ignorance of what happens when you go from working on learning Polymorphism to
writing a game engine in the span of a single day.
